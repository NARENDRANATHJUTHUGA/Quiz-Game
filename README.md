I’ve developed a colorful Java-based Quiz Game application with an interactive GUI using Swing. The game features a timer for each question, real-time score tracking, and a final review screen showing the results. This project helped me apply core Object-Oriented Programming concepts, event-driven programming, and GUI design in Java. It’s a great foundation for anyone learning desktop application development.
